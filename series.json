Its main stars were David Baddiel, Rob Newman, Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis.\r\n\r\nIt started in 1989 as a radio show, devised by Bill Dare, on BBC Radio 1. The two pairings of Newman and Baddiel and Punt and Dennis were central to the show - they would later have spin-off television series of their own. Guest performers included Nick Hancock, Jo Brand, Jack Dee, and Mark Thomas.\r\n\r\nIt had four radio series, building up an audience and moving to better time slots. After the fourth series, it was decided to move the show to television. The television run started in 1990 on BBC 2. It lasted two series, a total of 13 episodes including its pilot. A spin-off book of the show was also published.\r\n\r\nThe series was a mix of surreal sketches and monologues, in a format similar to shows such as Mr. Show and The Kids in the Hall. (The Kids in the Hall also had a sketch about a character who suffered from a disease that made him sound sarcastic much like this show's character 'Ray', although this appears to be coincidental)\r\n\r\nThe show was named after Mary Whitehouse, a prominent campaigner against what she saw as a decline in television standards and public morality. She became famous in the UK going after shows like Monty Python's Flying Circus and Doctor Who. She threatened legal action against the show for its name.\r\n\r\nThe television series has never been released nor repeated by the BBC. Episodes of the radio series have been repeated on BBC 7. An online petition has been set up to lobby the BBC to release the television series on DVD.\r\n\r\nA book The Mary Whitehouse Experience Encyclopedia, which was a spin-off of the series containing references to some of the sketches on the show and much new material, was released in 1991.",

What if the worst day of your life began your life's greatest adventure?\r\n\r\nMeet Nikko Zond, a hyper-intelligent but rebellious teenager stillâ¦ More mourning the death of his renowned archeologist mother and a virtual stranger to his workaholic father, Solomon. On the day Nikko gets kicked out of the latest in a long line of boarding schools, he discovers his father's career as a university professor is just a cover. Solomon is really head of the Veritas Foundation, whose agenda is to seek the truth behind the mysteries of history and civilization.\r\n\r\nTeaming up for the first time with his father, Nikko finds his parents' spirit of adventure clearly runs in his blood, as he inadvertently gets entangled in his dad's dangerous adventures. Soon, and against his father's better judgment, Nikko enters the high tech, classified world of Veritas and begins the adventure of his lifetime - a journey that will lead to the unlocking of universal mysteries and, hopefully, will bring him and his emotionally estranged father back together.\r\n\r\nThe Veritas team includes: The highly intelligent and mysterious Vincent Siminou, Solomon's closest confidant and protector; Calvin Banks, a high strung but brilliant by-the-books archaeologist; and Maggie, a cool and sophisticated computer scientist. And charged with the difficult task of trying to keep Nikko out of trouble is Juliet Droil, a beautiful and brilliant former student of his father's who will be Nikko's tutor and friend.\r\n\r\nFrom an excavation site of the pre-Roman civilization of Ancient Gaul to the North Pole, there is no place to which the Veritas Foundation will not venture in their mission for the truth. But a secret nefarious organization, seeking to destroy the Foundation's research, will never be far behind.\r\n\r\nThe series stars Ryan Merriman as Nikko Zond, Alex Carter as Solomon Z",

From his flat in Notting Hill Gate, Ray Purbbs edits an 'underground' (that is, counterculture) magazine, Mouth, assisted by his fellow hippies Alex, Jill and Hugo. Ray is passionate about protest, ludicrously enthusiastic about every hip trend and convinced he is (or could be) a major player in the battle between the Establishment and the alternative society. Alex - though he comes from a wealthy background and seems more interested in golf than altering society - is coolness personified, a man so laid-back he seems to exist outside of reality. Jill embraces all the new-found liberty afforded her gender and claims to espouse free love, though this attitude doesn't stretch to her 'boyfriend', Ray, long been deprived of her carnal interest. Hugo is spectacularly vague, almost brilliant in his obliqueness. Led by Ray, the quartet jump on every trendy bandwagon and comprehensively fail to make the slightest bit of difference in all they do. The gang are pretty useless at everything - in fact, they're not even that good at being hippies.",

Set in a skanky basement apartment, Internet Slutts stars MURK, a drug-addled bicycle courier, and his best friend WALLY, a pompous, opinionated fellah who bears a striking resemblance to a two foot tall penis. Savvy net browsers, Wally and Murk head to the web whenever they need to answer a pressing question such as \"Is peeing on people really a highly erotic sex act or just bad manners?\" They surf when they're researching a new hobby, looking for ways to scam some quick cash, or just plain bored and in the mood to waste valuable time building a virtual cow. They also leave the apartment occasionally - to get a brand new scrotal Celtic tattoo, rent their favourite adult videos, or take a survey of movie theatre urinal techniques.",

Ralph Bates was Michel Lebrun, the Deputy Director, who was concerned about keeping to the rules. Fiona Gaunt played Doctor Helen Smith, the base's psychiatrist, and Barry Lowe played Tom Hill, the head of the base technical section.\r\nThe programme was notable for its combination of realistic spaceflight procedures.\r\nAlthough very dated in terms of its looks and assumptions about the future, it remains well-regarded in retrospect.\r\n\r\n",

Unlike the film, its sequels, and the 1974 live-action television series, which involved a primitive ape civilization, Return to the Planet of the Apes depicted a technologically advanced society, complete with automobiles, film, and television; as such it more closely resembled both Boulle's original novel and early concepts for the first Apes movie which were changed due to budgetary limitations in the late 1960s.",

Cavalry Command was in essence a military organization, maintaining an army and fleet of ships to protect the New Frontier. Within Cavalry Command was a unit of special operatives known as Star Sheriffs that functioned as field agents, investigating crimes and plots against the security of the New Frontier.\r\n\r\nThe main foe of Cavalry Command and the Star Sheriffs was a race of non-human creatures known as Vapor Beings (or Outriders) that jumped into our dimension in order to conquer it. They attacked the settlers, destroyed settlements and kidnapped humans in order to mine various metals or crystals from the soil.\r\n\r\nOutriders were superior to humans in battle technology, possessing a legion of gigantic robots with uncanny firepower against which the space-going fleets of Cavalry Command were no match. In order to have a chance against such supremacy, Cavalry Command developed a prototype ship known as the \"Ramrod Equalizer Unit\" (or just Ramrod) that had the ability to turn from spaceship into a powerful robot that could fight the Outriders on equal terms.",

Timothy still lives at home with his parents and it's his smothering, bossy mother who insists on treating him as if he were still a little boy.\r\n\r\nHis father often joins Timothy in silent defiance of this Gestapo officer in a dress, and his sister Muriel--who left the nest, like a Colditz escape party, many moons ago--is often there to lend an ear and offer advice. Timothy would love to fly away, but the apron strings seem to be made of reinforced steel. Will he ever cut them? Will his romantic dreams ever come true? Or will his mother always sabotage his relationships, and he remain forever SORRY?",

The town was dominated by the namesakes of the founder, the Harper family, most prominently represented by the mayor, Otis Harper, Jr. (George Gobel).

Unlike the simple-minded man depicted in the movies, this cartoon had an intelligent, well-spoken Tarzan who was accompanied by a monkey sidekick, N'kima. In many ways, this series was the most faithful of all screen-based adaptations of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan, and featured a number of \"lost cities\" from the original novels. The rotoscoped animation is based upon the work of Burrough's favorite Tarzan artist, Burne Hogarth.",

      "overview": "There are few actors so closely tied to a persona than Raymond Burr as Perry Mason. This long-running series was built upon Erle Stanley GardnerÂ´s many novels about a brilliant defense lawyer and his staff, that solved many a crime with surprise witnesses and stern cross-examinations.It was the first mystery series to feature chalk or tape outlines to mark the spots where bodies were found. Filmed almost exclusively in the Los Angeles area, Raymond Burr had Gardner's seal of approval in the role. The cases were usually won by way of pivotal confessions of witnesses, solicited by Perry Mason (Burr's) surgeon-like examination or with last-minute, key evidence brought into the courtroom by private investigator, Paul Drake (William Hopper). Della Street (Barbara Hale), PerryÂ´s faithful secretary, was always at Perry's side in the courtroom where hapless Hamilton Burger (William Tallman) was the Los Angeles District Attorney who never seemed to win. As to the myth that Perry Mason never lost, there were 2 episodes where it did occur... but you'll have to watch to find out.The show was revived in 1973-74, with other actors in the familiar roles (Monte Markham as Mason), and then again with the some of the original cast, in a string of feature length TV films from 1985 until Raymond BurrÂ´s death in 1993.",

Thank You.\" When the Brown family takes him in, they get a lot more than they bargained for.\r\n\r\nPaddington is a stranger in a strange land and much of the charm of his adventures comes from his unique way of looking at the world. Many things others take for granted are exactly what he finds so fascinating and worthy of investigation.\r\n\r\nPaddington Bear has a knack for turning everyday life into an all-out adventure. Helpful and curious, Paddington always puts his paws where he shouldn't and inevitably finds himself in sticky situations. He doesn't go looking for adventure, it just seems to find him!\r\n\r\nBut that's part of his charm: Who else could take first prize at the dance contest without knowing the first thing about dancing? Who else could win the Tour de France â on a tricycle? And who else could inadvertently become a guest speaker at the White House?\r\n\r\nWhy Paddington, of course!",

There were several theme shows during \"Music Hall\"'s run, among them \"A Taste of Funny, \" hosted by Groucho Marx, \"The Golden Age of TV Comedy, \" hosted by Milton Berle, and \"The Best of Broadway, \" hosted by Henry Fonda. Frequent guest hosts included Berle, Eddy Arnold, John Davidson, and the singing team of Tony Sandler and Ralph Young. The Country Music Association Awards were first run as a special edition of the Music Hall in 1967. A victim of the general decline of weekly variety shows, \"The Kraft Music Hall\" was cancelled in 1971.",

The then federal structure of ITV, with its independent regional companies, meant that not all of these stations broadcast the show when it became available for networked transmission. Over time most ITV regions chose to broadcast it, with Granada Television and Southern Television being among the last to pick up the show, in 1979. Tyne Tees and Ulster eventually decided to take Tiswas for its final series in 1981. The smallest broadcaster in the network, Channel Television, did not carry the programme.",

They reveal their keen appreciation of Shakespeare by enacting Brutus and Cassius' quarrel in Julius Caesar and, in a nod to contemporary theatrical trends, Cleopatra's death scene is played in modern dress. To clear up any possible confusion, thereâs even a sketch to help viewers remember which one is which...\r\n\r\nThe series was billed on-screen as Two Of A Kind until 1963 and The Morecambe and Wise Show from 1964 onwards. However, for its entire run it was referred to by its stars and in TV listings as The Morecambe and Wise Show.",

      "overview": "Wimzie's House, an educationally entertaining series for preschool kids, premiered on YTV Canada 11 September 1995. Its PBS debut occurred 1 September 1997, after the series' production ended. The series presented the delightful adventures of Wimzie, a playful five-year-old puppet monster; her baby brother, Bo; her parents, Gratziella and Rouso-a bird/airplane pilot and dragon/firefighter, respectively; her lively 150-year-old grandmother Yaya, and her adorable puppet monster friends. Together, they learned skills of caring and sharing at Wimzie's House-a home daycare center unlike any other. Through unforgetable learning adventures and original toe-tapping sing-along songs, young viewers were introduced to topics like friendship, generosity, jealousy, diversity, and sibling rivalry, all from a preschooler's point of view. The award-winning series was created with a renowned team of educational advisors and designed to nurture children's sense of identity, expand their relationships, stimulate their curiousity, and encourage self-expression and self-esteem.",

      "overview": "This almost perfect cinematic rendition of Edith Nesbit's popular children's novel follows the lives of Roberta (Bobbie), Phyllis, and Peter, and their mother, after their father is unfairly accused of treason and sent to prison. They go to live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country which stands near a railway line â mum writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while the children spend much of their time around the railway station and, specifically, waving to one particular train to 'send their love to father'.\r\n\r\nAlways an involving and clever novel, the characters are here brought to life under the perceptive direction of Lionel Jeffries (better known as a fine character actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie, while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and brother. Their mother is Dinah Sheridan, while the other memorable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks the railway-man) and William Mervyn (the old gentleman on the train).\r\n\r\n'The Railway Children' is gentle entertainment from another age, but does its job beautifully. As we watch Bobbie grow up with the worries of an absent parent jostling against her own needs both to be alone and to have fun, we can only rejoice when events come together at the close of the picture. Throughout we have a sense of time and place â be it from the steam trains, the university paper chase, or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls (and used to avert disaster!).",

Weiss as Jarod, a genius and former child prodigy with the ability to become anyone he wants to be, i.e., to flawlessly impersonate anyone in virtually any line of work. Patrick Bauchau and Andrea Parker co-starred as Sydney, Jarod's childhood teacher and mentor, and Miss Parker, a childhood friend. They are both operatives for a mysterious organization called \"The Centre\", which took Jarod from his parents as a child and developed his special talents with the intention of making him one of their agents, while also using his brilliant intellect for their own evil purposes. After escaping from their custody, Jarod begins traveling the country, searching for clues to his true identity while posing as a doctor, police officer, attorney, or some other character who helps those in trouble. The Centre's directors are determined to return Jarod to The Centre to further their mysterious plan. A team of operatives, led by Miss Parker, attempts to find and capture The Pretender. Jarod's extreme intelligence combined with his childlike innocence create a memorable and endearing character that was popular with viewers.",

It follows the day-to-day tensions, passions, triumphs and failures of one of the most unique professions on earth.\r\n\r\nThe series focuses on the zoo as a modern-day Ark, where animals are increasingly protected from the threat of extinction. As one of the world's biggest zoos, it has expanded its longstanding role as an exhibitor to devote more of its resources to protecting endangered species.\r\n\r\nThe style of the series is best described as \"docusoap.\" There are three interwoven stories in each episode, some continuing week to week. Sometimes the stories are of life and death struggles. At other times, they are cute and humorous. Featuring real people in real situations, the series is intended for an adult audience, with some episodes not suitable for young children."

From the writer and executive producer of \"The Karate Kid\" and \"Kiss of the Dragon\" and the executive producers of Smallville, The WB's \"Black Sash\" features a multigenerational cast, dazzling martial arts and stories of hope and redemption.\r\nAs an undercover narcotics cop, Tom Chang (Wong) paid a high price for staying true to his values. Framed and wrongly incarcerated in Hong Kong for allegedly smuggling heroin, he loses his career, his wife and the right to see his daughter. All he has left are the blazing skills of a master martial arts combatant. Now, after five years in a Hong Kong prison, Tom has come home to San Francisco, intent on restoring his life.\r\nOnce back in San Francisco, Tom's mentor, Master Li (Mako, Pearl Harbor), gives Tom his martial arts school to run and a place to live in his building on the wharf. Tom finds a new family in the young men and women he trains in Chinese martial arts. His dedicated students include Tory Stratton (Missy Peregrym, Dark Angel, The Chris Isaak Show), a fiercely beautiful 17-year-old who has turned to martial arts as a way of dealing with the rage she feels over the death of her policeman father. A newcomer to the group, Trip Brady (Corey Sevier, Little Men ) is the victim of a violent father. For Trip, Tom's knowledge and kindness open the door to a new life. Bryan Lanier (Ray J, Moesha) is a tough-talking, streetwise teenager with a quick wit and a deep loyalty to his fellow students and to Tom. Another newcomer is the shy and warm-hearted Allie Bennett (Sarah Carter, Undeclared), who is searching for acceptance, friendship and for some of the skill and bravery she admires in Tory.\r\nTom relies on the spiritual guidance of Master Li to help him deal with issues that arise in his life and the lives of his students",

The show comprises a series of spoof interviews, involving Jamie Theakston questioning Lucas and Walliams, who play famous musicians. The interviews are often bizarre and involve broad, unflattering caricatures or just downright fictional characteristics. They are often interspersed with videos by the featured artist, including humorous captions and congratulations from other impersonated celebrities.",

      "overview": "\"140 years ago in Kyoto,with the coming of the 'Black Ships', there arose a warrior called Hitokiri Battousai. Felling men with his blood stained blade, he closed the turbulent Bakumatsu era and slashed open the age known as Meiji. Then he vanished, and with the flow of years, became a legend. In the 11th year of Meiji, in the middle of Tokyo this tale begins...\"\r\n\r\nRurouni Kenshin (the OAVs and Movie are known as Samurai X) tells the story of a wanderer named Kenshin, who used to be called Hitokiri Battousai (Hitokiri means Assassin) during the Japanese civil war, and is now trying to make up for his past and all his murders by helping those in trouble with his reverse-blade sword and by using his powerful technique called Hiten-Mitsurugi Ryu to battle oppressors of freedom and justice, yet struggling with himself and his own murdering self.\r\n\r\nDuring the series Kenshin joins others in his quest: Kaoru Kamiya, a young orphan girl who became tutor of the Kamiya-Kashin Ryu Kendo style; Sanosuke Sagara, a mercenary who used to bear the name Zanza and fights just with his incredibly powerful fists; Yahiko Myojin, a young boy who was rescued by Kenshin from a band of thieves and now a pupil on Kaoru's dojo; and Megumi Takani, a female doctor who was rescued by Kenshin from a band which forced her to make a lethal drug. Together they all fight those who oppress the weak while they seek their destiny as well happiness and redemption.\r\n\r\nThe series is based on a homonymous manga created by Nobuhiro Watsuki, which was first published in 1994.",

The show follows the bachelor as he goes on a series of dates with the women, some of them group dates, some one-on-one dates. On each episode women are eliminated, generally during the rose ceremony at the end of the episode, but sometimes on the dates (during what are called \"elimination dates\"). The process culminates towards the end of the season with a few of the women going on overnight dates, and meetings between the bachelor, the women, and their respective families. At the end of the show, the bachelor chooses one woman with whom he would like to continue a relationship. Sometimes he proposes marriage, sometimes other levels of commitment.\r\n\r\nThe runner-up from the first season, Trista Rehn, later starred in The Bachelorette, a spin-off program in which the format is gender-reversed.",

(During its first season, it ran from 9â10 p.m. E.T.) Virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show; opera singers, popular artists, songwriters, comedians, ballet dancers, dramatic actors performing monologues from plays, and circus acts were regularly featured. The format was essentially the same as vaudeville, and although vaudeville had died a generation earlier, Sullivan presented many ex-vaudevillians on his show.  Seasons 1-8 can be found listed under the series \"Toast of the Town\".",

      "overview": "Harvard-trained Latino attorney John Alvarez defies all expectations with his witty and nonconformist attitude. The comedy series depicts his character struggling to fit in the upscale corporate culture as well as his parents' blue-collar world. Although he works for a prestigious Manhattan law firm, John remains loyal to his traditional Queens, New York upbringing, and he never lets his success get in the way of his family and childhood friends. Living and working together with his beautiful attorney girlfriend Nancy Slaton has its advantages, but it's a romance kept secret from the firm which has strictures against dating co-workers. Nancy is a fun-loving, intelligent perfectionist with a good heart. Since she is very much in love with John and quite the opposite of him, her conservative Upper East Side upbringing balances her relationship with her no-rules boyfriend. John has always been more of a leader than a follower, as his father, Luis Alvarez, would tell you. As a working class barber who owns a barber shop in Queens, Luis is very proud of his lawyer son. He is John's biggest fan, but his old-world ways sometimes put him at odds with his unconventional son. Despite John's nonconformist nature, his more conventional colleagues know he can get the job done. Ruthlessly ambitious attorney Henry Beckett will go to any length to advance in the firm. Not too scrupulous about how he gets ahead, he can be somewhat sarcastic and constantly finds himself challenged by office manager Maria Marquez. Famous for her long and wild nails, Maria is witty and flamboyant, and she efficiently does her job. The nervous and somewhat hapless Peter Gutenhimmel is an uptight associate whose father is a partner in the firm, and he never seems to truly live down his nepotistic origin.",
